<h1> The Impact of Algorithmic Content Delivery on Users WMC </h1>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p> 
In the process of conducting my thesis capstone project for my undergraduate studies in Psychology, Despite it being a simulated study, I still feel it is important that I maintain a high degree of precision in the study design process. In this goal, I intend to leverage my programming skills which I have developed in my secondary area of study, computer science. By employing the knowledge and techniques acquired though my computer science coursework, I aim to enhance my capabilities in psychological data and statistical analysis, thereby contributing to the overall rigor and validity of my current and future psychological and engineering studies. 

For my simulated research investigation, which centers around the effects of algorithmic content delivery on the working memory capacity(WMC) of users, I have opted to utilize high-level dynamically typed programming languages such as Python in conjunction with associated software libraries like pandas and statsmodels. These tools will assist me in facilitating the execution of my hypothesis tests, the computation of confidence intervals, the estimation of effect sizes, and the performance of power analysis, regression analysis, and generalized data analysis procedures.

In order to determine the optimal sample size(n=??) needed to detect an effect size with a corresponding level of confidence, a pilot study is required. However with my limited resources I have opted to fabricate data instead. The fabricated data is a result of an artificial pilot study, in which subjects were exposed to three algorithmic conditions, a Content- ranking algorithm condition, a recommendation algorithm and a infinite scrolling algorithm. While being exposed to each algorithmic condition subjects ocular saccade amplitude and saccade velocity was tracked and collected via a eye tracker apparatus. 

After being exposed to each successive condition, subjects are than tasked to complete a OSPAN, RSPAN and Flanker exercise. Both the OSPAN and RSPAN tasks can be measured as a raw score or as a proportion, for the purposes of my study design, I feel it is most appropriate to score according to the ratio of the raw score and the total number of items presented throughout the task. Both the OSPAN and RSPAN tasks measures WMC, which is the ability to store and manipulate information simultaneously, the score in the csv data files reflects the number of items correctly recalled with higher scores indicating better WMC. The data format score for both the SPAN and RSPAN is 0-60. 

The flanker task is measured by reaction time difference in milliseconds between congruent and incongruent items. On the contrary, the Flanker task measures attentional filtering and controls, specifically the ability to suppress irrelevant stimuli while focusing on target stimuli. The data format in which is used is the time difference in ms. The values in the flanker task data files represents the difference in reaction time between congruent and incongruent trials. Lower values indicates better attentional control.  At the core of my research design are the statistical models that will serve as the foundation for subsequent analyses. It is evident that a within-subjects design is most suited for the paradigm of my study. Within this framework, I will employ a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, regression analysis, and post hoc tests.
